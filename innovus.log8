=======================================================================
*info: Total 1053 net(s) have violated hold timing slacks.

Buffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    59 net(s): Could not be fixed because of no legal loc.
*info:     3 net(s): Could not be fixed because of hold slack degradation.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

Resizing failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     3 net(s): Could not be fixed because of hold slack degradation.
*info:   393 net(s): Could not be fixed because instance couldn't be resized.
