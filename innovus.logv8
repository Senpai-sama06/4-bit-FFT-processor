[10/30 17:35:51    328s] **ERROR: (IMPIMEX-7031):	#CUI#restoreDesign#read_db# more than once in the same Innovus session is dangerous and not recommended. Some internal state of applications or global settings cannot be reset, so it's not reliable enough in real flow. If you are just experimenting and/or debugging and accept the risks, you can set the global restore_db_stop_at_design_in_memory to 0 and try again.
